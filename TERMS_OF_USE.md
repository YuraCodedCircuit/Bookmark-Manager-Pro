# TERMS OF USE

*Last updated March 13, 2025*

## AGREEMENT TO OUR LEGAL TERMS

We are Bookmark Manager Pro ("we," "us," "our"), a free, open-source browser extension designed to manage bookmarks efficiently, similar to an OS file manager.

We operate the browser extension Bookmark Manager Pro (the "Extension"), as well as any other related products and services that refer or link to these legal terms (the "Legal Terms") (collectively, the "Services").

You can contact us by email at [YuraWebDev@proton.me](mailto:YuraWebDev@proton.me) or through our GitHub page: [https://github.com/YuraCodedCircuit/Bookmark-Manager-Pro/issues](https://github.com/YuraCodedCircuit/Bookmark-Manager-Pro/issues).

These Legal Terms constitute a legally binding agreement made between you, whether personally or on behalf of an entity ("you"), and Bookmark Manager Pro, concerning your access to and use of the Services. You agree that by accessing the Services, you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by all of these Legal Terms. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ALL OF THESE LEGAL TERMS, THEN YOU ARE EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED FROM USING THE SERVICES AND YOU MUST DISCONTINUE USE IMMEDIATELY.

Supplemental terms and conditions or documents that may be posted on the Services from time to time are hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to make changes or modifications to these Legal Terms from time to time. We will alert you about any significant changes to these Legal Terms through a notification within the Bookmark Manager Pro extension itself upon its next launch, in addition to updating the "Last updated" date above. You waive any right to receive specific notice of each such change beyond these methods. It is your responsibility to periodically review these Legal Terms to stay informed of updates. You will be subject to, and will be deemed to have been made aware of and to have accepted, the changes in any revised Legal Terms by your continued use of the Services after the date such revised Legal Terms are posted.

We recommend that you print a copy of these Legal Terms for your records.

If we terminate your support access, you are prohibited from seeking support or updates again.
