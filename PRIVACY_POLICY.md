# Privacy Policy

*Last updated: February 25, 2025*

This Privacy Policy describes our policies and procedures regarding the handling of user data when using the Bookmark Manager Pro browser extension.

## Interpretation and Definitions

### Interpretation

The words of which the initial letter is capitalized have meanings defined under the following conditions. The following definitions shall have the same meaning regardless of whether they appear in singular or plural.

### Definitions

For the purposes of this Privacy Policy:

- **Application** refers to Bookmark Manager Pro, the browser extension provided by the Company.
- **Company** (referred to as either "the Company", "We", "Us" or "Our" in this Agreement) refers to the creators of the Bookmark Manager Pro.
- **Device** means any device that can access the Application, such as a computer or a digital tablet.
- **You** means the individual accessing or using the Application.

## Data Handling and Storage

### No Data Collection

Bookmark Manager Pro does not collect any user data. All user data, such as bookmark names and URLs, is stored locally on the user's device. There is no transmission of data to external servers, and the extension operates entirely offline.

### Local Data Storage

Data is saved using the 'LocalForage' JavaScript library, which stores the data in the browser's IndexedDB. This ensures that all data remains on your device, and no data is shared with third parties or external services.

### Security of Local Data

While We strive to ensure that Your data remains secure on your Device, please note that We cannot guarantee the absolute security of data stored locally, as this may be affected by factors outside of our control, such as the security of your Device or browser.

## Links to Other Websites

Our Application may contain links to external websites. These are not operated by Us, and We have no control over their content or privacy policies. We encourage You to review the Privacy Policy of any site you visit.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify You of any changes by updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy. You are encouraged to review this Privacy Policy periodically.
